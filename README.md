TO DO

## Stretch Goals
* Add more hill spawn locations
* Put the lists into one dictionary (for coordinates)
* Make different leveled rooms spawn different kinds and number of npcs
* AI NPCs
* Animated Sprites
* Joystick controller functionality
* Tunnels between rooms
* Create "game over" screen with restart
* Ability to block

## To Do
* Remove delay when swinging (is there a way to automatically remove the sword once a certain tick has between hit?)

## Bugs
* getting rid of the wrong npc

## Ideas
* Have blocks that can be broken with an axe or other action. They can also be broken with a sword (have hp)
but take lots of damage with an axe
* Count the number of rooms you have been through
