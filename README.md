## Playing the Game
TO DO

## Minimum Viable Product Goals
* One room game
* Randomly generated obscalcles
* Randomly generated NPCs (that are not using AI)
* Up, down, left, right movement

## Stretch Goals
* Multiple rooms with cohesion between them
* AI NPCs
* Animated Sprites
* Joystick controller functionality
* Tunnels between rooms

## To Do
* Implement image for attack
* Create "game over" function/class
* Just touching the arrow keys should only turn them (or some way to turn) - way to count how long a key has been pressed?
* Wait to move until more inputs are recieved? (See bugs)
* Put the lists into one dictionary (for coordinates)
* Block function?
* Get rid of removable status (not necessary?)

## Bugs
* Can tap a key multiple times quickly and the movement is delayed

## Ideas
* Have blocks that can be broken with an axe or other action
